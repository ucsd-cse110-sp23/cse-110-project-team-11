Write a poem about yesterday


I remember yesterday
The day of smiles and laughter
When I held hands with my friends
Like sisters and brothers.

We skipped in a care free way
Not worrying about anything
Living with pure joy in that day
Not fretting what the future may bring.

We frolicked and played in the sun
Until we were so very tired
No stress ever to be found
Just glee from a quiet heart inspired.

We said goodbye with a hug
Promising to meet again soon
Remembering the one simple day
Reminiscing about having so much fun.
